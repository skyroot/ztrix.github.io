<p>There are many <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses">licenses</a> out there for open source software. <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license">GPL</a>, <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>, <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0">Apache License</a> are most popular ones among them.</p>

<p>When creating projects on <a href="http://github.com">github</a>/<a href="http://code.google.com">google code</a>, there even is an option for people to choose the most popular licenses.</p>

<p>But to me, those licenses are boring, and for most of the time, I think, nobody care about them, very few people can distinguish them. Actually, it&rsquo;s just put into a project occupying an embarrassing position, maybe just to make a project feels more like a formal one, and in active developing.</p>

<p>Why not make those licenses more interesting, and attach some social functions for developers?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;ve come up with an idea called, <a href="https://github.com/zTrix/star-and-thank-author-license">Star And Thank Author License</a>. The key points are</p>

<ul>
<li>People need to star/+1/Like the project which uses <a href="https://github.com/zTrix/star-and-thank-author-license">SATA License</a>.</li>
<li>People need to thank the authors of the project listed in the <a href="https://github.com/zTrix/star-and-thank-author-license">SATA License</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here I am going to explain in details.</p>

<h2>How about forking a project with <a href="https://github.com/zTrix/star-and-thank-author-license">SATA License</a>?</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/zTrix/star-and-thank-author-license">SATA License</a> stated that</p>

<pre><code>Contributors of this project by forking have the option to add his/her name and 
forked project url at copyright and project url sections, but shall not delete 
or modify anything else in these two sections.
</code></pre>

<p>So, when someone used a project B which is forked from project A, he/she still needs to Star and Thank the original project A. For project B, if the author listed himself/herself in the <a href="https://github.com/zTrix/star-and-thank-author-license">SATA License</a>, then the users of project B also need to star and thank author of project B.</p>

<p>Things are the same if some other developers forked project B. First he need to star and thank the authors of project A and B, then he can list himself in.</p>

<p>Thus whatever point you access in the fork tree, you have to star and thank all the authors from the fork tree leaf up to the root of the tree.</p>

<h2>How to star/+1/like projects?</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com">Github</a> are the most popular source code hosting and social coding platform, there is a <code>star</code> button at the top-right corner of project home page. For google code hosting, you can <code>+1</code> the project, and for others, there is always some <code>like</code> or <code>thumb up</code> system, just click them.</p>

<h2>How to thank project authors?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve suggested a few in the license text, but not limited to those</p>

<ul>
<li>Email the authors a thank-you letter, and make friends with him/her/them.</li>
<li>Report bugs or issues.</li>
<li>Tell friends what a wonderful project this is.</li>
<li>And, sure, you can just express thanks in your mind without telling the world.</li>
</ul>


<p>Actually, the thank-author process can be done in any ways you think OK. Star and thank author are just designed to attach social interaction functions to licenses. When you email a thank-you letter, no matter long or short, you build up a connection with the author. That&rsquo;s why I think you should let the author know you are grateful. Social developing has unlimited power, without which, Linux will be impossible to be such a success.</p>

<h2>Which License is SATA License based on?</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/zTrix/star-and-thank-author-license">SATA License</a> is based on <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>. I only added several lines. You can also create your own customized <a href="https://github.com/zTrix/star-and-thank-author-license">SATA License</a> by sublicensing <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license">GPL</a>, or any others.</p>

<p>Remember the primary goal and key point of <a href="https://github.com/zTrix/star-and-thank-author-license">SATA License</a> is to make licenses social. Don&rsquo;t limit yourself in those unimportant details.</p>

<p>Enjoy social coding with <a href="https://github.com/zTrix/star-and-thank-author-license">SATA License</a>!</p>
